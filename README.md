# Fare-Price-Prediction-using-RF
In the last few years, the number of for-hire vehicles operating in NY has grown from 63,000 to more than 100,000. However, while the number of trips in app-based vehicles has increased from 6 million to 17 million a year, taxi trips have fallen from 11 million to 8.5 million. 
Hence, the NY Yellow Cab organization decided to become more data-centric. Then we have apps like Uber, OLA, Lyft, Gett, etc. how do these apps work? After all, that set price is not a random guess.
This case study is to predict the taxi fare for a taxi ride in New York City from a given pickup point to the agreed dropoff location. Decision tree and Random Forest regressor is used for the fare prediction.
